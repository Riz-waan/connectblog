With the rise of AI, ethical concerns have become increasingly significant. One critical consideration for AI developers is the variation in ethical values across different cultures. For instance, some cultures regard animals as equal to—or even more important than—humans, while others place a much higher value on human life. In one culture, it may seem unthinkable for a self-driving car to choose a human life over a pack of dogs, whereas in another, allowing harm to animals might be viewed as deeply unethical. These cultural differences are not hypothetical—global research has shown that ethical preferences in life-and-death scenarios involving autonomous vehicles differ widely. For example, countries in the “Southern” moral cluster (including many Latin American and French-influenced regions) showed a much weaker preference for sparing humans over animals, compared to Western and Eastern clusters[^1].

### Using AI for determining Organ Recepient
The study by Awad et al.[^1] demonstrated that cultural values significantly influence moral decision-making, particularly in scenarios involving the value of human life. Some cultures placed greater importance on older individuals, while others prioritized the young. Similarly, certain societies favored individuals with higher social status or those who obeyed the law. These findings highlight the potential to use such insights in designing fair and culturally aware priority models for organ allocation. However, further research is necessary to ensure these models align with the values of the communities where they are implemented. This approach not only respects cultural sensitivities but also avoids imposing any perception of moral superiority.

### Autonomous Driving in Healthcare
With the increase in autonomous delivery robots, it is possible for stretchers and patient transport to become automated. However, for this to work, the system must be able to actively monitor the patient's condition and assess the priority level.
